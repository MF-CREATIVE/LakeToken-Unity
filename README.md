# LakeToken

Lake Token invites players to embark on a serene and immersive fishing adventure. As an angler, the player will begin their journey by spawning at a tranquil dock situated on a vast, picturesque lake, surrounded by breathtaking natural scenery. This sprawling lake features an array of water features like tree stumps, tall grass, rocks, and more, which will have a direct impact on the type and amount of fish in each area.

Immerse yourself in the game's minimalist 3D low-poly style, complete with stunning atmospheric effects and weather changes that evolve with each passing moment. The ambient sounds and soft music will transport you to a peaceful oasis, providing the perfect environment to unwind and enjoy the simple pleasures of life.

The game employs a coin system that enables players to earn coins by selling their fish. With these coins, players can purchase and upgrade boats from the boat shop located on the dock. The bait and tackle shop on the dock offers a range of rods, reels, lures, and other fishing essentials that will come in handy during your quest to catch the biggest and rarest fish in the lake.

➡️ Inspiration Inspired by summer time memories, the smell of the water and the rush of having a fish on the line.

➡️ What it does We wanted to make a game that offers a place to relax, socialize, catch some Web3 fish and have endless fun.

➡️ How we built it We built it using Unity, Blender, and coordinated with Discord and Miro. We implemented Thirdweb's Unity SDKs and then used the Artic network, as it is EVM compatible, to host our game on the testnet.

➡️ Challenges we ran into Cooperation, communication, and a lack of Unity developers. We learned as we went and gave it our best efforts. Also, the Artic network was down on the day we submitted our project, so we used the POLYGON testnet until the Artic network was back up and running.

➡️ What we learned We learned a lot about teamwork and having the right team members to complete the tasks required to build a Web3 game. We are happy with our final submitted project as we added new team members in the last week with the skill set required to get the game completed.

➡️ What's next for Lake Token We would like to develop Lake Token into the best fishing game experience in Web3 and develop a storyline. Funding would really help us achieve this vision as we all work day jobs and finding the time can be difficult. Dedicating more time to what we are all passionate about as a team would be the dream.
